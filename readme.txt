This plugin for WordPress redirects the WordPress login page to the WooCommerce “My account” page, so you can standardize the way everyone logs in to your site! This page can be set in the Dashboard > WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced tab. You can also use this to create seamless checkouts that require users to login or create an account.

This plugin will automatically hide the redirect information in the address bar (if JavaScript is enabled), protecting against manipulation, and providing a more seamless user experience. It will also keep any URL (GET) parameters. These redirects can also include additional parameters for any developers out there, for both pre and post-authentication customization. It also supports the wp_login_url() and wp_logout_url() functions, passing the redirect and additional parameters to the login page and interrupting the default redirect to the "My account" page on logout if a redirect is specified, respectively.

Advanced Usage Example:
wp_redirect(wp_login_url('/your-target/here/?with=additional&post-authentication=parameters') . '&with=additional&pre-authentication=parameters');
This will pass the URL GET parameters within the wp_login_url() function to the final destination (post-authentication redirect) and pass the URL GET parameters near the end to the WooCommerce "My account" page (to be used pre-authentication), such as WooCommerce notices, session variables, tracking information, etc.

== This plugin is fully compatible with WordPress Multisite installations, as well as subdirectory installations! Best of all, IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY CODING KNOWLEDGE! ==

== Installation ==

1. Upload `woo-wp-login` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. And that's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I need this? =
If you've ever wanted to utilize a custom login page, and you currently have an eCommerce site using WooCommerce, this is the plugin for you.

= What does it do? =
It redirects the standard wp-login.php page to your default WooCommerce "My account" page, which is set in the Dashboard > WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced tab.

= Could this plugin break my site? What if I have WooCommerce disabled or the "My account" page option isn't set? =
This plugin is built to check first if WooCommerce is in fact installed and active using the is_plugin_active() function (Please note that this plugin includes "wp-admin/includes/plugin.php" in case it is not already).
Next, this plugin will check if the "My account" option in WooCommerce Settings is set.
Only after both of these dependencies are met will the plugin actually redirect your wp-login.php page.
If you decide to deactivate WooCommerce, or unset the "My account" page, no worries! Your site will continue to function normally, using the standard wp-login.php page.

= What happens to my wp-login.php redirects? =
We keep them, of course! They will be preserved when redirecting to your WooCommerce "My account" page and once logged in, will be used to redirect the site visitors to their desired destinations! This requires no configuration. These redirects will simply be to the initial page that prompted the login. For example, if you attempt to access the Admin Dashboard when logged out, this plugin will redirect the default wp-login.php page to your set WooCommerce "My account" while also getting the redirect query string from the login page in the process, so that upon successful login, you will be redirected to the Admin Dashboard.
